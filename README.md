# vsmod-AntiCheese

A Vintage Story mod which prevents some cheesing/cheating.

Prevents the client from seeing entity debug info, which is normally shown with `.clientconfig showentitydebuginfo 1`.

Entity Debug Info gives away hidden enemy locations and can provide knowledge of where hidden underground caves are.
